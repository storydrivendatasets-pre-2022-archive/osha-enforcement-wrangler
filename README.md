Downloads all the CSVs found here:

https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php ([mirror](https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php))


# TODOS

- [ ] Finish scripts/collect/stash_csvs.py
    - [X] Index configured files by year, when possible [decided no need for this]
    - [X] Don't numerically index single file groupings, unless they are more than ARBRITARY_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT, e.g. 20MB
- [ ] Write compile script
    - [ ] have to write function to manually join narratives (or can we do it in SQL?)
